# Bioinformatics Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to programming assignments from a course on bioinformatics algorithms. Each lesson directory focuses on a different topic ranging from motif search to Hidden Markov Models.

## Structure

- `lesson1` – fundamental string operations on DNA sequences
- `lesson2` – probabilistic motif discovery methods
- `lesson3` – string reconstruction and de Bruijn graphs
- `lesson4` – sequence alignment algorithms
- `lesson5` – phylogenetic tree construction
- `lesson6` – text indexing techniques such as the Burrows–Wheeler Transform
- `lesson7` – hidden Markov models and related algorithms

Example scripts are stored in the `examples` directory. Most programs can be run directly with Python 3.
